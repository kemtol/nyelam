If the mountaineers have the Everest Peak as a mecca, then the divers choose Raja Ampat as a sacred destination that must be visited. Raja Ampat underwater wealth has been recognized world. Not a few foreign diver who want to bother coming all the way here to explore the beauty of the underwater Raja Ampat. No less a class expert Gerry Allen also said: "This is a diving paradise and marine biota exploration laboratory"

Diving is a mandatory activity in Raja Ampat. You can go to small island called Friwen Mondai. Direct coral overflow presented beautifully. Various forms of coral reefs grow here and there. All are healthy and intact. Things like this are hard to come by in snorkeling spot elsewhere. The fish milling about in very large quantities.

The underwater contours around Friwen Mondai allow you to witness a variety of coral reefs. The seabed close to the island has a depth of about 3 to 4 meters. Not far from there, immediately turn into a slope or a cliff with a depth of dozens of meters. Various soft corals with different colors grow in vertical position. Sunlight that penetrates into the water radiates into ray of light files.

## What to expect diving in Raja Ampat

Biogeographical lines are enjoyable. OK they may well not appear it, but underwater they're nothing like a garden fence. These are overlapping areas where biodiversity has a celebration with an explosion of varieties which will make for jaw-dropping diving activities. Located off of the northwest idea of Bird's Mind Peninsula on the island of New Guinea in Indonesia's Western Papua Province, Raja Ampat's 1,500 roughly islands, cays and shoals are centred about the four main islands of Misool, Salawati, Batanta and Waigeo.

Raja Ampat is revered within diving circles as among the finest places on the globe to dive. The macro life, for example, is a cacophony of family pets created by the mixing up of marine life from both attributes of Lydekker's brand. Further up the meals chain will be the huge shoals of seafood of most sizes, manta rays and sharks and the remoteness of the positioning and having less tourist activity has generated a dive vacation spot that few can match. Just list the varieties that inhabit the Raja Ampat archipelago and traditional western Papua can be an exercise in futility, as there's a whole lot.

Raja Ampat has a deluge of types large and small at so many sites that it's hard to choose the best. Probably the most iconic are pygmy seahorses, imitate octopus, plus more shrimps than you can wave an antennae at. Then there are fish shoals so big you can conceal a London bus in them as well as mantas that can audition for the Royal Ballet Institution they are simply so beautiful and elegant. Finally come whalesharks, a kinds that could have problems with vertigo so high are they over a diver's wish list.

My personal favorite marine creature are available here in plethora. Manta rays are what you'd get if you can see gracefulness. They may be insanely beautiful and serene, yet for their size (manta rays expand to over two metres extensive) they could be tricky to picture.

Fortunately Raja Ampat has its manta ray sites where encounters with several family pets are common. That provides photographers an improved potential for getting near a person. With a broad angle zoom lens or adaptor suited to your camera you should be as near the animal as is possible. However, there's a trick which will get close enough. If you swim at the ray, it'll swim off. They don't prefer to be directly contacted, so the most sensible thing to do is stay still. Appears odd I understand, but mantas are inquisitive as soon as you spark their interest chances are they'll approach you.

## Bottomline

Sadly, frequently there are divers who's exhilaration has got the better of these and they hurry headlong at a manta to just watch it flip and take flight away. Luckily, should this happen in Raja Ampat, itâ€™s likely that you will see other mantas nearby, and courses become proficient at keeping divers relaxed.

If you visit Papua and Raja Ampat be certain to state a many thanks on the breeze to Richard Lydekker and the discoveries biogeography has manufactured in the spot. Raja Ampat is a jewel for the earth and diving this is a privilege.
