The undersea currents flow of the Komodo National Park are known to be quite strong, divers are often required to have an advanced diving certificate to enjoy certain amazing diving points. But don't worry, for novice divers you'll be safe just do what your instructor said. This national park has plenty of beautifull coral reefs that can be enjoyed. One of the most famous places that all tourists can enjoy is Pink Beach. Beach sand that looks pink is a favorite place for diving, snorkeling, or just relaxing on the beach. But remember, this place is still the habitat of Dragon Komodo so stay alert.

To do scuba diving, divers can choose several Dive Operators around the pier. Most are managed by foreign operators. There are also a several Dive Center owned by citizens such as CN Dive and Ora Dive. CN Dive, established a seasoned ranger, Mr. Condo Subagyo in 1987, operates several Phinisi ships. The Phinisi boat owned by CN Dive is equipped with a dinghy boat, or a small boat to shuttle to the dive spot. Dinghy boat is very important in diving in the Komodo National Park area, because it is able to pick up divers in areas that are difficult to reach.

Do not miss the beauty of hundreds of bats flying at sunset on Kalong Island and try to spend the night on a boat over the sea near Komodo Island. Because the distance is quite far from Labuan Bajo, liveaboard is the best way to enjoy this National Park. You can rent a wooden boat with a variety of size options to explore this national park. Liveaboard above Phinisi is my favorite. This traditional Indonesian ship is quite large so it is very comfortable. Often equipped with air conditioning and hot shower facilities. Quite luxurious.
