Our country, the Unitary Republic of Indonesia, is divided into 3 time zones because it is one of the largest countries in the world. With an area of 1.9 million km2, the three time zones are West Indonesia Time (WIB), Central Indonesia Time (WITA), and East Indonesia Time (WIT). Each time zone has its own natural beauty area and there are many dive spots that can't be missed, because Indonesia is also an archipelago.
