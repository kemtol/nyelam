Living in Jakarta as the capital city of Indonesia with its hustle and bustle is guaranteed to cause fatigue and exhaustion to the society. A getaway to nature tourism is certainly a solution to get out of that saturation. But, which destination is affordable to go to for a short escape? In terms of distance, price, and nature atmosphere, Pulau Harapan can be your main and first choice. It is located in Kepulauan Seribu, 3 hours straight from Muara Angke, Jakarta, taken with a speedboat or traditional boat. 

Before you off to Pulau Harapan, it is better to plan an eco trip considering that many natural tourist destinations in Indonesia are polluted by irresponsible activities.

Moreover, there are many attractive spots to take photos and you can blend in with the lives of local people.
