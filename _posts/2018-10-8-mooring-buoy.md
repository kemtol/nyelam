Do you ever recognize that the existence of our coral reefs in Indonesia is getting decreased and damaged? Not only the coral reefs, the marine life like fish and its surroundings are also threatened. This matter is caused by ships that often park and throw anchors carelessly, so now there is *Mooring Buoy* provided to anticipate it. *Mooring Buoy* is basically a floating mooring that is used for mooring ships and as a sign or mark to drop the anchors. Therefore, the *Mooring Buoy* holds the ship from shifting due to waves, currents or wind. It has the heaviest weight than other types of buoy.

## What are the characteristics of Mooring Buoy?
The color of *Mooring Buoy* is usually bright to make it easy to see remotely. But to close the possibility of not being seen at night, it has a lamp with a solar cell that stays on at night. It is equipped with sinker to put on the bottom of the sea, and chain to connect the sinker with shackle. *Mooring Buoy* helps ships to get moored properly and to avoid the loss or damage of underwater biota. Moreover, it is used as a warning sign for ships if the depth of the sea is too shallow, so the ships won’t get closer. Large vessels that want to carry out loading and unloading activities but cannot approach the dock are also helped by *Mooring Buoy*. 

## Is there any movement to support the Mooring Buoy?
Related to the concern and willingness to develop *Mooring Buoy*, there is a community named **Laskar Terumbu**. It contained a group of ardent divers and sea enthusiasts, established by *Rendra Hertiadhi*. They form a movement called **“Seribu Mooring Buoy Project”** or in short you can call it **“SerBu Project”**, which they have cooperation with **MASI (Masyarakat Selam Indonesia)** and some other communities.  The community will do mooring buoy installation activities in all dive spots in Indonesia and has successfully conducted trials in Kepulauan Seribu. 

## How to maintain the Mooring Buoy?
So that the *Mooring Buoy* can continue to function optimally, proper maintenance needs to be done. Every once in 4 months, regular checks must be carried out to determine the conditions of buoy, ropes, chains and anchors. *Mooring Buoy* has a manhole to check regularly to ensure that there is no leakage and the buoy condition remains excellent. Besides, the ability of each mooring must be recorded, and do an update to know the latest depth and GPS position of each mooring. The users of *Mooring Buoy* can also participate in preserve it, by cleaning the rope from moss or helping to replace or install the *Mooring Buoy*.

By getting to know more about *Mooring Buoy*, it is expected that our level of awareness of its importance will increase. If we don’t help in improving the *Mooring Buoy*, who else will preserve the beauty of our country’s underwater? So, let’s start the movement now!
