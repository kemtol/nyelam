Snorkeling and diving are most likely become the most favorite water sports
nowadays. Plus, it is fun and adventurous activities that allows you to explore more the
beauty of marine life. Both diving and snorkeling have some basic similarities, it uses a mask,
snorkel and fins. The difference came to tell that snorkeling involves, of course a mask and
tube – while diving involves more complicated set of equipment.

## Meaning of Snorkeling and Diving
** Diving ** is a form of underwater diving with a few of breathing equipment. ** Snorkeling ** is
swimming on the underwater with a snorkeling mask. Snorkeling allows you to observe so
much corals and species beneath the surface of the water. Meanwhile, diving allows you
only to explore at much greater depths than snorkeling yourself can reach. The purposes of
diving are usually specific. For example, there is recreational diving – this kind of diving
includes wreck diving, cave diving, etc. While there is professional diving – it mainly includes
underwater welding, offshore construction, or even for military purposes.

## Dangers and Risks
Snorkeling is relatively safe. The only danger is if you got contacts with poisonous corals,
jellyfish stings, also dehydration and hyperventilation. Others it came from sunburned for
long hours near the surface of the water. Meanwhile, diving invents a real danger if you got
less attention on it. Most common of the danger is if the effects of breathing compressed air
such as oxygen toxicity, refraction and underwater vision.

## Training
Diving requires training in how to use the breathing equipment and safety procedures. For
snorkeling, there is no training. Generally, dives from sea level about 3 to 12 feet are
favored by snorkelers. Diving with a tank allows you to stay underwater as long as you want
without the need of hold your breath. While snorkeling, there are similarities for doing it as
well. You also feel free to do it as long as you please as your breathing tube allows you to
have an access to go deeper under the surface of the water.

All in all, both of these underwater sports offer huge opportunities for adventure.
Diving gives an experience for those of you who haven’t experienced so much under the
water by requiring some serious training as well as in using breathing equipment. While
snorkeling gives you a free time and swims freely under the surface of the water, in order to
require more practice and experience in repeated breath holding. Whichever sports you
want to try, no need to worry. Because both of them is beneficial and, of course, make sure
you play underwater safely.
