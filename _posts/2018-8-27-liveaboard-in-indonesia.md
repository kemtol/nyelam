Simply, Liveaboard means a person who lives on a boat, or a boat suitable to live on. However, in diving, liveaboard means a scuba diving purposely-build boat, or an existing vessel that is offered to diving trips which usually last longer than one night. The capacity of the boats is varied; it could host between 12 and 30 divers, but those who want to get private one, it could host less than that.

## All The Adventurers Aboard
Liveaboard has been a choice not only for divers but also the travellers who want to enjoy a unique adventure on the sea. Although it tends to be quite pricey compared to regular scuba diving, liveaboard still appeals middle-up societies out there. It is also getting more interesting due to a lot of different activities to do while on board. For instance, a liveaboard operator, Steppes, offers liveaboard with experts onboard in November or December where the guests can sail around Raja Ampat, West Papua, and dive up to four times a day in the company of the cameraman behind David Attenborough’s Blue Planet and Planet Earth, Doug Allan. Liveaboard also becomes the best choice for those who want to reach dive locations that are far from the coast and can only be reached by liveaboard such as Socorrro in Mexico and Galapagos in Ecuador.

## Indonesia Has The Most Exotic Liveaboard
Unfortunately, not every dive destination is a liveaboard destination. However, Indonesia has it all. There are quite many operators in this country offering liveaboard. Cajoma Indonesia, for instance, sells relatively cheap liveaboard dive trip with adapted Indonesia’ traditional boat, Phinisi, in Komodo Island at the price range of USD 5800 – 7300 which can accommodate up to six people for 5 days trip. Some communities and local travel agencies usually make liveaboard trip as well. Kapan Pulang, a travel agent headquartered in Bali, arranges 5 days liveaboard trip in Komodo with affordable price at the price of USD 850 or approximately IDR 12,000,000 per person.

The services on liveaboards vary substantially. Usually, operators offer video nights, photography clinics and marine life talks as the most popular services to the guests. The operators will also organize the whole trip from the airport pick up to transfer you again to the airports after the trip. In general, all divers are expected to bring their own diving or snorkelling equipment, however, you could also book them by letting the operators know in advance. Some points you should notice before booking are prerequisites of the operator that might ask you several requirements such as insurance, level of diving and nitrox certification.
