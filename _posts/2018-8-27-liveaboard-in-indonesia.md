Nowadays, many people are interested in vacationing on the island. In addition, many people enjoy their vacation by going diving or snorkeling on an island, and enjoy their time on luxury liveaboard. Before that, we must know the true meaning of liveabord.

## What Is Liveaboard
Simply, Liveaboard means a person who lives on a boat, or a boat suitable to live on. However, in diving, liveaboard means a scuba diving purposely-build boat, or an existing vessel that is offered to diving trips which usually last longer than one night. The capacity of the boats is varied; it could host between 12 and 30 divers, but those who want to get private one, it could host less than that.

## All The Adventurers Aboard
Liveaboard has been a choice not only for divers but also the travellers who want to enjoy a unique adventure on the sea. Although it tends to be quite pricey compared to regular scuba diving, liveaboard still appeals middle-up societies out there. It is also getting more interesting due to a lot of different activities to do while on board. For instance, a liveaboard operator, Steppes, offers liveaboard with experts onboard in November or December where the guests can sail around Raja Ampat, West Papua, and dive up to four times a day in the company of the cameraman behind David Attenborough’s Blue Planet and Planet Earth, Doug Allan. Liveaboard also becomes the best choice for those who want to reach dive locations that are far from the coast and can only be reached by liveaboard such as Socorrro in Mexico and Galapagos in Ecuador.

## Indonesia Has The Most Exotic Liveaboard
