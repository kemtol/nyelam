Looking for a new diving experience with affordable budget? **Tulamben** is a worth spot to try for those who are seeking for a wide variety of underwater beings and brand-new dive sites! It is a small fishing village on the north-east cost of Bali and famous internationally because of the *USAT Liberty Shipwreck Cargo*. Most of scuba divers consider this place as one of dive sites with the best beach access in the world. 

## Water Temperature and Weather
If you are wondering when to visit **Tulamben**, May until October is the perfect time to dive there because it is during the dry season. The winds are regularly weak and the seas tranquil at the time. The water temperature is also mild enough, around 26-30 degrees during this period. While the weather is most likely to be good with nice average temperatures, so it won’t be a concern. 

### Visibility 
Somehow, visibility can be reduced and drop during the rainy season, so you can’t really see anything down there. Luckily, visibility is best during these months of dry season, and divers can see an increase in pelagic species. Even on good days the visibility can climaxing at 120 ft or 40 meters!

### What to See
From July until October, **Tulamben**, especially the wreck, is very crowded with divers. Make sure this won’t prevent you from a sunrise dive on *the Liberty* to have it all to yourself! It is not only an amazing wreck dive, but it is also a truly living reef with its history. You should go diving earlier in the morning before 8 am, so it will be less crowded, and you can enjoy it better. What to see more other than *the Liberty wreck*? *Coral Garden* can be in you to-do-list. It offers you to see rare corals and fish you can never find in other places. The depth and location make it as a popular spot to do night dive and snorkeling.
